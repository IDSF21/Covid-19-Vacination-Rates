Goals

- EDA
- Extract promising subsets of the analysis from the EDA and use the most promising interactions
- Use streamlit to build web application
- Have interactions that make it possible to enable exploration of either: Dataset or ML Model (use either exploration or storytelling)
- Cut scope and explore only critical dimensions - add layers of complexity from there
- Ensure that streamlit app is tightly focused
- Do user tests: can people look at your app and understand what the data is saying? can they clearly see an answer to a compelling question? 
- Complete Writeup containing A clear description of the project's goals, A rationale for our design decisions, and A clear description of the goals of the project




The issues involved in implementing an interactive data science application in Streamlit 

You will build an interactive application that enables the exploration of a dataset or a machine learning model of your own choosing. 

A critical challenge will be scoping the assignment such that you can complete the time available.


Focus on designing a limited yet compelling application that enables interactive exploration along a few critical dimensions, and then layer on additional complexity.  

A tightly-focused, well-implemented interactive application is much preferred to a sprawling design that attempts too much!

You can use any data for this project.

Design an interactive Data Science application to explore or understand a compelling question for a dataset of your own choosing. 

In order to determine what subset of the data and which interactive options are most promising, we encourage you to perform additional exploratory analysis.

What aspects of the data reveal the most interesting discoveries or stories? 

Do not feel obligated to try to convey everything about the data: focus on a compelling subset.

Your application must include interactions that enable exploration or storytelling. 

Possible techniques include panning, zooming, brushing, details-on-demand (e.g., tooltips), dynamic query filters, and selecting different measures to display. 

You are free to also consider highlights, annotations, or other narrative features intended to draw attention to particular items of interest and provide additional context.

Implement your application in Streamlit or Panel using python. You should load data from a static data file or public web API.

Your repository should also include a write-up with the following components:

A clear description of the goals of your project. 
Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. 
The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals. 

A rationale for your design decisions. 
How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? 
What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

An overview of your development process. 
Describe how the work was split among the team members. 
Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
    Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? 
    What aspects took the most time?

### Grading Criteria

    Projects that squarely meet the requirements for the assignment will receive a score of 95.  
    Going beyond the call of duty can net additional points, for example:

        advanced interaction techniques
        novel visualization or interactive elements
        thoughtful and elegant graphic design
        insightful & engaging exploration experience
    
    Point deductions will be made when projects suffer from:

        errors or broken features
        clearly ineffective visual encodings
        confusing interface design or unhelpful interactions
        lack of exploratory interaction techniques
        incomplete or insufficient write-up
    
    If done as a group there will be expectations that multiple interactions will be presented (ie. twice as much work expected).
